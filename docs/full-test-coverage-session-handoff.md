# Full Test Coverage Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-21

## How To Resume In A New Trusted-Hooks Session

The active goal in the old Codex thread is a compressed summary. It captures the
mission, but it does not contain every operational rule from the original
campaign prompt. Use this file plus `docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md`
as the handoff.

Start the new Codex session from the repository and trust hooks when prompted:

```bash
cd /Users/jeffscottward/Github/tools/Maestro
```

Paste this prompt into the new session:

```text
Continue the Maestro full test coverage campaign in /Users/jeffscottward/Github/tools/Maestro on branch full-test-coverage.

Read these files first:
- docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md
- docs/test-coverage-audit.md
- docs/full-test-coverage-session-handoff.md

Treat docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md as the canonical original prompt. Preserve unrelated dirty/untracked files. Do not commit unless explicitly instructed. Do not add or widen coverage exclusions without explicit approval except generated, type-only, or pure barrel files. Keep tests meaningful, update the audit after each checkpoint, and run targeted tests plus broader validation before moving on.

Current first action:
1. Run git status --short --branch.
2. Confirm the "Upstream Sync Recovery Checkpoint" in docs/test-coverage-audit.md is present.
3. Continue from the post-sync unit-coverage state. Unit coverage is at 100% with thresholds enabled after merging upstream/main.
4. Do not start integration or E2E unless the user explicitly approves that next phase.
```

## Current State

Repository:

- Path: `/Users/jeffscottward/Github/tools/Maestro`
- Branch: `full-test-coverage`
- Do not assume the worktree is clean. It contains many existing modified and
  untracked files from this campaign and possibly unrelated user work.
- User authorized commits for the upstream sync checkpoint.
- Pre-sync checkpoint commit: `ec5bce785 test: reach full coverage checkpoint`.
- Upstream merge commit: `c1f56704f merge upstream main into coverage branch`.
- Post-sync repair validation is green for the current checkpoint; check
  `git log --oneline -3` for the latest checkpoint commit.

Canonical prompt:

- `docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md` contains the original campaign
  prompt in repo-local form.
- `docs/test-coverage-audit.md` is the running audit.

Latest full coverage run:

- Command: `npm run test:coverage`
- Result: passed
- Thresholds: global 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines enforced in `vitest.config.mts`
- Coverage:
  - Statements: 100% (63,667/63,667)
  - Branches: 100% (44,693/44,693)
  - Functions: 100% (13,680/13,680)
  - Lines: 100% (59,568/59,568)

Post-upstream sync status:

- `upstream/main` from `https://github.com/RunMaestro/Maestro` has been merged
  into `full-test-coverage` with no conflicts.
- Unit coverage has been restored to 100% after the merge.
- Formatting, lint, ESLint, full unit test, and full unit coverage validation are green.
- A first post-sync test-signal cleanup slice removed `act(...)` warnings from
  `useWorktreeValidation.test.ts`, `ProcessMonitor.test.tsx`, and
  `AutoRun.test.tsx` in isolation while keeping 100% coverage green.
- A second cleanup slice removed `useBatchProcessor.test.ts` stdout leakage and
  React `act(...)` warnings in isolation; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A third cleanup slice removed `UpdateCheckModal.test.tsx` React `act(...)`
  warnings in isolation; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A fourth cleanup slice removed `WizardIntegration.test.tsx` missing-session
  mock stderr, expected error-path logs, and React `act(...)` warnings in
  isolation; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A fifth cleanup slice removed `session-storage.test.ts` storage logger output
  in isolation by suppressing and verifying expected storage-layer `info`,
  `warn`, and `error` messages; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A sixth cleanup slice removed `AutoRunBlurSaveTiming.test.tsx` React
  `act(...)` warnings in isolation by wrapping edit/save/key/rerender flows in
  local `act` helpers; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A seventh cleanup slice removed `AutoRunContentSync.test.tsx` and
  `AutoRunSessionIsolation.test.tsx` React `act(...)` warnings in isolation by
  keeping unrelated token/image async work pending and wrapping async save
  clicks in `act`; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- An eighth cleanup slice removed `WizardThemeStyles.test.tsx` React
  `act(...)` warnings in isolation by using React Testing Library `waitFor`
  for wizard async updates and waiting for resume-modal validation to settle;
  full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A ninth cleanup slice removed `useSummarizeHandler.test.ts` React `act(...)`
  warnings in isolation by using React Testing Library `waitFor`, wrapping
  direct `startSummarize()` calls in `act`, and wrapping operation-store state
  seeding for cancellation coverage; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- A tenth cleanup slice removed `useMergeSession.test.ts` React `act(...)`
  warnings in isolation by wrapping long-running merge launch points in `act`
  for concurrent-merge and cancel-merge coverage; full unit coverage remains
  at 100%.
- A latest cleanup slice removed `HistoryPanel.test.tsx` expected TanStack
  Virtual smooth-scroll stderr output in isolation by suppressing and verifying
  only the known dynamic-size smooth-scroll warning; full unit coverage remains
  at 100%.
- A latest cleanup slice removed `LeaderboardRegistrationModal.test.tsx`
  manual-token fallback `act(...)` warnings in isolation and stabilized two
  `ProcessMonitor.test.tsx` assertions that raced the post-load expand-all
  effect during full-suite runs; full unit coverage remains at 100%.
- Integration and E2E have not been started after the sync checkpoint per user instruction.
- Remaining near-term work is to continue unit-test signal cleanup, likely
  App shell tests, AgentSessionsModal, batch reducer failure-path tests,
  DocumentGraphView, WorktreeRunSection, or explicitly approve the next
  integration/E2E phase.

## Known Test-Signal Noise Still Present

Full coverage still passes but emits existing noise, including:

- React `act(...)` warnings in renderer hook/component tests outside the
  cleaned `useWorktreeValidation`, `ProcessMonitor`, `AutoRun`,
  `useBatchProcessor`, `UpdateCheckModal`, and `WizardIntegration` files.
- Expected error stack traces in `ErrorBoundary` and provider/theme tests.
- `useSymphony` tests logging `getIssueCounts is not a function` from incomplete
  window API mocks.
- Settings and remote integration tests logging expected stdout/stderr.
- SSH command builder tests logging full wrapped command metadata.
- A post-sync unit audit exposed a flaky `TabSwitcherModal.test.tsx` search
  assertion caused by random `agentSessionId` values matching the search query.
  The test now uses explicit IDs for that scenario.

Do not silence these globally. Prefer local spies/assertions where the test
expects the log.

## Suggested Next Work

Current state as of 2026-05-21:

- `npm run test:coverage` passes with global 100% thresholds enabled.
- Latest coverage totals: statements `100% (63,667/63,667)`, branches
  `100% (44,693/44,693)`, functions `100% (13,680/13,680)`, lines
  `100% (59,568/59,568)`.
- Latest full unit run passes: 730 files passed, 1 skipped; 28,519 tests
  passed, 106 skipped.
- Latest checkpoint is recorded in `docs/test-coverage-audit.md` under
  `Test Signal Cleanup Checkpoint: Leaderboard Modal And ProcessMonitor Harnesses`.
- Latest full-suite signal counts: stdout sections 879; stderr sections 44;
  React `Warning:` lines 164; `act(...)` mentions 326.
- Bare `useInlineWizardContext` missing-provider error stacks are now 0.
- Upstream sync status: `upstream/main` from
  `https://github.com/RunMaestro/Maestro.git` was fetched and merged with
  `-X theirs`; the merge was a no-op because this branch was already current
  with upstream. Local unit-signal checkpoint commits have continued after that
  sync.
- No coverage exclusions were added or widened for this checkpoint.
- Integration and E2E remain deferred until explicitly approved by the user.

Next work is unit-test signal cleanup unless the user explicitly approves the
integration/E2E phase:

1. Continue with the next largest noisy unit areas, likely App shell tests,
   history/leaderboard component tests, AgentSessionsModal, batchReducer tests,
   ConversationScreen rendered tests, DocumentGraphView tests, WorktreeRunSection
   tests, ErrorBoundary tests, or useRemoteHandlers tests.
2. Keep each cleanup local: prefer `act` wrappers, pending/deferred async helpers,
   and local log spies/assertions for expected failures.
3. Rerun targeted tests plus `npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage` after
   each checkpoint that changes shared test behavior.
4. Run formatting/lint gates after doc or test edits:
   `npm run format:check:all`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run lint:eslint`.
5. Review and document remaining noisy expected-error output. Do not silence it
   globally; prefer local spies/assertions where the test expects the log.
6. Perform the final code-review pass and complete the final response required by
   `docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md`.

## Final Completion Reminder

Do not mark the campaign done until the completion audit proves every
requirement in `docs/full-test-coverage-campaign-prompt.md` is satisfied:

- 100% coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines, or every
  remaining item has documented, justified, user-approved narrow exclusions.
- Thresholds in `vitest.config.mts` enforce the achieved level appropriately.
- Critical workflows have integration/E2E coverage where unit tests are
  insufficient.
- Required final commands pass or have documented environment blockers.
- Final audit identifies tested behavior, remaining risk, exclusions, threshold
  status, and test-quality assessment.
