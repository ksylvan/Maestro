 * mentionPatterns - single source of truth for detecting `@file` and `@agent`
 * mentions inside raw input text.
 *
 * Both the live AI-input highlight overlay (InputArea) and the rendered
 * transcript remark plugin (remarkMentionChips) tokenize with the SAME function
 * here, so the two surfaces can never disagree about what counts as a mention.
 * The dispatch scanner in `crossAgentContext` scans through the same
 * {@link scanMentionSpans} helper, so "what the picker inserts", "what dispatch
 * routes", and "what renders as a chip" all trace back to one definition.
 *
 * Disambiguation is by SHAPE, so a single `@` covers both kinds:
 *   - A path-like body (`@src/main`, `@notes.md`) is a file mention.
 *   - A bare word (`@codex`, `@review-bot`) is an agent/group mention, but only
 *     when it names a KNOWN agent/group (see `knownMentionNames` below); an
 *     unknown bare `@word` stays plain text, exactly like a bare `@todo` is not
 *     treated as a file.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (shared/) so it imports cleanly from the main, renderer,
 * and cli tsconfigs.
