/**
 * Additional Directories - extra paths an agent may read from and/or write to
 * beyond its working directory.
 *
 * Everything the desktop, the CLI, the prompt renderer, and the per-provider arg
 * builders need to agree on lives here:
 *
 *   1. `normalizeAdditionalDirectories` - what gets persisted on the session
 *      (tilde-expanded, trimmed, de-duped).
 *   2. `formatAdditionalDirectoriesForPrompt` - the markdown block substituted
 *      into `{{ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES}}` in the Maestro system prompt. EVERY
 *      agent gets this, whether or not its CLI can enforce anything.
 *   3. `dirsWithAnyAccess` / `dirsWithWriteAccess` / `repeatDirFlag` - the
 *      building blocks each provider's `additionalDirArgs` uses in
 *      `src/main/agents/definitions.ts` to translate grants into its own CLI
 *      vocabulary.
 *
 * Two layers of enforcement, and they are not equivalent:
 *
 *   - PROMPT (all agents): carries the full read/write nuance, including
 *     write-only, but is only as good as the agent's obedience.
 *   - NATIVE (agents with `supportsAdditionalDirectories`): actually enforced by
 *     the provider, but COARSER. No CLI today can express "write but never
 *     read", so a native grant opens the directory and the prompt is what holds
 *     the line on the finer rule.

The Conductor has granted you access to these directories in addition to your working directory. The listed permission is a hard rule, exactly like the working-directory restriction above:

- **Read + Write** - read from and write to this directory and its subdirectories.
- **Read only** - read freely; never create, modify, move, or delete anything inside it.
- **Write only** - create and modify files here; never read the existing contents back.

| Directory | Access |
| --------- | ------ |
${rows}

These grants are additive. Every other directory outside your working directory remains read-only for reference and off-limits for writes. If a task needs access this list does not cover, say so instead of reaching outside it.`;
