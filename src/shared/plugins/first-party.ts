 * disclosure (the broker capabilities the feature's host code actually
 * touches), a settings namespace, and its supervised background services.
 *
 * This is intentionally metadata, not an installed third-party plugin.json:
 * the implementation code stays first-party (host code, trusted by
 * construction, no vm sandbox), while the marketplace exposes the same
 * category/permissions/service shape users expect from plugin-backed
 * features and lifecycle routes through the host-owned
 * `FirstPartyPluginBridge` (src/main/plugins/first-party-bridge.ts).
 *
 * Definitions land statically: feature workers edit their entry in
 * `FIRST_PARTY_PLUGIN_DEFINITIONS` in place (refining permissions against
 * what the feature ACTUALLY touches and registering their background
 * services). The registry is keyed by Encore flag because the flag is the
 * lifecycle handle the settings store, IPC togglers, and bridges share.
