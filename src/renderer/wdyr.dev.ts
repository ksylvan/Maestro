/**
 * why-did-you-render setup for development performance profiling
 *
 * This file is only loaded in development mode via Vite's alias configuration.
 * In production, the empty wdyr.ts is used instead.
 *
 * To track a specific component, add this to the component file:
 *   MyComponent.whyDidYouRender = true;
 *
 * Or track all pure components by setting trackAllPureComponents: true below.
 *
 * Output appears in the browser DevTools console showing:
 * - Which components re-rendered
 * - What props/state changes triggered the re-render
 * - Whether the re-render was necessary

// between renders and crashing libraries that use internal React hooks
