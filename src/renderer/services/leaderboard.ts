 * user, since the server keeps its own totals. That means any local time which
 * never ships a delta drifts permanently below the leaderboard total.
 *
 * So: every path that grows `autoRunStats.cumulativeTimeMs` must also submit
 * its delta through here, or the local Conductor level and the leaderboard
