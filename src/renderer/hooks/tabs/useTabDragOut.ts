 *
 * Tracks a tab drag in screen coordinates and reports when the cursor leaves the
 * owning window's bounds. This is the foundation the cross-window move / new-
 * window-on-drop wiring builds on: in-bar reordering is untouched (it runs on
 * `onDragOver`/`onDrop` against sibling tabs), and drag-out only "engages" once
 * the cursor exits the window.
 *
 * Bounds are snapshotted once per drag (on {@link UseTabDragOutReturn.beginDragOut})
 * rather than re-queried per move - a window is not resized mid-drag, and one
 * IPC round-trip per drag keeps the move path cheap. The latest cursor point is
 * kept in a ref so feeding samples never forces a re-render; only the boolean
 * exit state is React state, and it is set only when it actually changes.
 *
 * While the cursor is outside the owning window, each sample also resolves which
 * other Maestro window (if any) sits under it via `windows.findWindowAtPoint()`.
 * That lookup is async, so it is coalesced to a single in-flight IPC: the newest
 * point arriving mid-flight is stashed and fired when the previous one settles,
 * trailing-throttling a fast drag to the round-trip rate instead of flooding the
 * main process. The resolved target is held in a ref for the drop handler to read.
